# Easy add javascript/CSS on your website

(รอรูป)

RVsitebuilder 7 is the plugable application that allows several Apps to install on it and use with your website. 


Long story short, it allows you to install Apps from our [Apps Marketplace](https://apps.rvsitebuilder.com) to use on your website aside from cool features we already provide in RVsitebuilder.


But in case if sometimes you really want to add Javascript/Css on your page in order to make your website more wow, you can also do that in our **HTML Mode**.


1. Make sure the Javascript/Css you got is correct and working properly.


2. At Content tab, click on any content section of the page you want. On **Section Editor**, click on **html mode**.


*javascript is supported here, you dont need to insert script in File Manager*


3. Insert the Javascript/Css


4. Don't forget to **Save**.


5. Click on **My Site** to see what you just have done.


6. If there's nothing in action or it shows and error, please check the script again for if it's really correct.
