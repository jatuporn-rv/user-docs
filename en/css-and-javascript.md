# Easy add javascript/CSS on your website


RVsitebuilder 7 is the plugable application that allows several Apps to install on it and use with your website. 


Long story short, it allows you to install Apps from our [Apps Marketplace](https://apps.rvsitebuilder.com) to use on your website aside from cool features we already provide in RVsitebuilder.


But in case if sometimes you really want to add Javascript/Css on your page in order to make your website more wow, you can also do that in our **HTML Mode**.


### Add Javascript/Css by page

1. Make sure the Javascript/Css you got is correct and working properly.


2. At Content tab, click on any content section of the page you want. On **Section Editor**, click on **html mode**.
