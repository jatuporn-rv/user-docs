5. **Pricing**: If you run a business or sell a product on your website, you probably have a dedicated pricing page for the whole thing. You'll notice the best pricing pages have clean layouts, use simple language that speaks to the customer, and aim to inspire trust between the business and the user.
6. **Contact**: The goal of every contact us page is to convert by clearly and effectively presenting the method(s) of getting in touch with a company as quickly as possible.
7. **Table**: If you are presenting data and information using columns and rows, then these best table website templates are ideal for you.
