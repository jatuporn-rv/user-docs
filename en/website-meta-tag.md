Once **Meta tag** clicked, you will be at Page Management box.

- **Menu Pages** on the left colum will bluely highlight the current page that you're going to set its Meta tag now. You can change to other pages from here.

- **Page Management** with current page name on the right column. Insert embed meta tag here. And connect with Google API by this guide.
