## Adding Page and Menu are easy as by following this guide

First, a little to know is adding Page and adding Menu are not the same part.

Adding page is to add new content area for your new content. It WILL NOT appear on website navigation unless you add it to a Menu.

Adding menu is to add new Top Menu or Menu on website navigation. You can define **Page** for the new added menu immediately or later.

### Adding New Page

1. In Content editor, click "+" floating menu, and select **New Page**.
