# Apps

RVsitebuilder 7 is a full function CMS, and it's also a tool that allows you to have more Apps to use with your website aside from features in content editor.

You can navigate it from **Apps** -> **Manage**.

Once **Apps** clicked, you will be at My Apps page.

It lists all current enabled apps for your website. The default 7 apps are always enabled for every website by default.

You can install more apps to use with your website such as Sitemap, Weather, and many others by visiting our [Apps Marketplace](https://apps.rvsitebuilder.com/).
